# Module 1: Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of the Project
Louise is an up-and-coming playwright who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play, Fever. She has an estimate budget of about $10,000. In this project, we will analyze crowdfunding data to understand what makes a campaign successful to help Louise plan her own campaign.

The purpose of the analysis in the Kickstarter Challenge is to help Louise understand and visualize how each of the theater campaigns compared in relation to their launch dates. Along with that, the data will help her understand the outcomes based on the original goals of each play. Through the analysis, we can provide suggestions that will help Louise meet her goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date

From the analysis of theater campaigns based on launch date, there was a grand total of 1369 campaigns (not including ones that are currently live). From the grand total, there was a total of 839 successful, 493 failed, and 37 canceled theater campaigns. After analyzing the results, we can conclude that the best time for Louise to launch a campaign is mid-year, especially May. She should avoid launching campaigns at the end of the year from October to December, as they performed very poorly.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

From the outcomes based on goals analysis, we can say that goals of $45,000 and greater has a larger percentage of failing than being successful. The higher the goal, the larger the fail rate is. For goals that are between 0 to about $15,000, they have about a 50% to 80% chance of being successful. Taking that information we can compare that with Louise's estimated campaign goal of $10,000. From that, we can conclude that Louise's estimated campaign goals has about a 55% success rate.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
My main challenge during this project was making sure I was using the correct data when typing out my formulas. The COUNTIFS() functions caused my the most difficulits and I was stuck on it for a long time. I used the function correctly, but it was not outputting the correct data chart. I ended up going back and double-checking my formulas and data and was finally able to get correct results.

## Results
The results from the Kickstarter Challenge, shows us that the best time for Louise to launch a campain is during mid-year, especially May. Also, launching a campain towards year-end has a large rate of failure and Louise should avoid launching between October and December. Also, our analysis shows that Louiseâ€™s funding target of $10,000 only has a 55% chance of being successful, we suggest that she should aim for a lower target goal, as they have a 80% success rate.

### Limitations
The biggest limitation of this dataset is that demographic information was not included in the analysis. For Louise's purpose, I suggest adding Country demographics and filter it to the country that Louise would be launching her crowdfunding campaign. This would provide a more accurate analysis on the success of these theater campaigns.
